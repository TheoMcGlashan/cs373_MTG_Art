To run this on your own, first run save_iamges.py with command line argument of either "colors" or "rarity". This will download many images to your computer, so make sure you have storage for several gigabytes.
Then, run classifier.py with the same command line argument you used for save_images. To switch between colors and rarity, move the images for one run of save_images to another folder, then run save_images with the other argument.
